2D game engine implemented in Java along with a demo Mario level. To run, you must have Gradle 6.3 and Java 1.8 or higher. From the project's root directory, open command prompt and run "gradle fatJar" to create a Jar file for the project and it's dependencies, which will be stored in the build folder. Open that folder and the libs folder inside it to find and run the jar. You will have to arrange the ImGui windows since their placement cannot be exported.
