2D game engine implemented in Java along with a demo Mario level. To run, open terminal in project's root directory and run `gradle fatJar`. Next, run `java -jar build/libs/mario-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar`. The ImGui windows will need to be repositioned and resized since their placement cannot be exported.
